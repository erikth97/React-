npm i react-bootstrap

Local setup
Yarn is our package manager of choice here. Check out setup instructions here if you don't have it installed already. After that you can run yarn run bootstrap to install all the needed dependencies.

From there you can:

Run the tests once with yarn test (Or run them in watch mode with yarn run tdd).
Start a local copy of the docs site with yarn start
Or build a local copy of the library with yarn run build
